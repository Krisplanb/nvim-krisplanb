# Work Log

This is a personal log of my progress and troubleshooting while building and testing my Neovim config.

---

## 2025-06-30 – Third Time Cloning
- Tried setup script generated by ChatGPT
- Fixed incorrect path in `setup.sh` (`config/nvim` → `.config/nvim`)
- Updated copy command to reflect real repo structure
- Ran setup script — everything worked without errors

---

## 2025-06-29 – Second Time Cloning
- Neovim and APT install-guides worked
- Forgot to commit snacks- dashboard function to git last time — same error appeared
- ASCII image converter had issues; changed install method
- Commented out Mason warning about pylint/isort
- Dependencies seem stable now
- Decided to make an install script to save time

---

## 2025-06-28 – First Time Cloning
- Started from scratch on new VM
- Many `require("sethy")` references — renamed to `krisplanb`
- `snacks.lua`: dashboard command got a function adjustment
- Identified and documented missing dependencies
- Learned that `apt install neovim` gives old version (v0.9)
- Made guide for Neovim 0.11.2 tarball install
- made a manual install guide
- System stable after fixing config errors

---

## Notes & Fixes

### snacks.lua
- `cmd = "ascii-image-converter"` now dynamically selects a picture from `.config/nvim/assets/`

### oil.lua
- `delete_to_trash` set to `false` — no trash system on most Linux servers

### noice.lua
- Replaced icons like `󰥻` with simpler digraph symbols

---

## Install Script Dependencies

- `luarocks`, `build-essential`, `ripgrep`, `fd-find`, `npm`, `python3`, `golang`, etc.
- `ascii-image-converter` from custom APT source
- Global `pyright` from npm
- Neovim 0.11.2 installed via tarball to `/opt/nvim`

---

## Neovim Manual Install Steps (for reference)

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/v0.11.2/nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar xzvf nvim-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv nvim-linux-x86_64 /opt/nvim
sudo ln -s /opt/nvim/bin/nvim /usr/local/bin/nvim
```
