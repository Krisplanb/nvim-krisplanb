# Neovim Config (Experimental)

This is my personal **experimental** Neovim configuration, built for a headless **Linux** setup.

> ⚠️ Use at your own risk. This is a live setup that changes frequently.

## Quick Start

Install everything with one command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krisplanb/nvim-krisplanb/main/setup.sh)
