# Neovim Config (Experimental)

This is my personal **experimental** Neovim configuration, primarily intended for **Linux**.

> ⚠️ Use at your own risk. This setup is a work in progress and may change frequently.

## Inspiration

The base setup is adapted from [sin-cy's dotfiles](https://github.com/Sin-cy/dotfiles),  with my own custom changes and additions.

## Goals

- Minimal but functional
- Fast startup
- Plugin management via [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

## Notes

- the base from sin-cy was made for mac
- This config is built and tested on Linux only.
- Some features may not work on macOS or Windows.

## intentions and Milestones

- first goal is to adapt to linux based setup
